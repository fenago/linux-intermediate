Lab: System Backups
===================

In this lab, you will learn how to put a group of files together
into a single archive. You will also learn how to compress an archive
file using various compression methods.


Creating an archive
===================


Let\'s create a backup for all the bash scripts in the
[/home/elliot] directory. As the [root] user, create a
directory named [backup] in [/root]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~# mkdir /root/backup
```


Now let\'s create an archive named [scripts.tar] in
[/root/backup] for all the bash scripts in [/home/elliot].
To do that, we first change to the [/home/elliot] directory:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~# cd /home/elliot 
root@ubuntu-linux:/home/elliot#
```

Then we run the command:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:/home/elliot# tar -cf /root/backup/scripts.tar *.sh
```

This will create the archive file [scripts.tar] in
[/root/backup], and there will be no command output:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:/home/elliot# ls -l /root/backup/scripts.tar
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 20480 Nov 1 23:12 /root/backup/scripts.tar
```

We could have also added the verbose option [-v] to see the files
that are being archived:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:/home/elliot# tar -cvf /root/backup/scripts.tar *.sh 
3x10.sh
detect.sh 
empty.sh 
filetype.sh 
fun1.sh 
game.sh 
hello20.sh 
hello2.sh 
hello3.sh 
hello.sh 
math.sh 
mydate.sh 
noweb.sh 
numbers.sh 
rename.sh 
size2.sh 
size3.sh 
size.sh
```


Viewing archive contents
========================

To view the contents of the archive [scripts.tar]
that we just created, you can run the command:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:/home/elliot# tar -tf /root/backup/scripts.tar 
3x10.sh
detect.sh 
empty.sh 
filetype.sh 
fun1.sh 
game.sh 
hello20.sh 
hello2.sh 
hello3.sh 
hello.sh 
math.sh 
mydate.sh 
noweb.sh 
numbers.sh 
rename.sh 
size2.sh 
size3.sh 
size.sh
```

As you can see, it listed all the files in the [scripts.tar]
archive.


Extracting archive files
========================


You may also want to extract files from an archive. To demonstrate,
let\'s create a directory named [myscripts] in [/root]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:/# mkdir /root/myscripts
```

To extract all the files in the [scripts.tar] archive to the
[/root/myscripts] directory, you can run the following command:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:/# tar -xf /root/backup/scripts.tar -C /root/myscripts
```

The [-x] option is the shorthand notation of [\--extract],
which extracts the files from the archive. We also used the [-C]
option, which basically changes to the [/root/myscripts] directory
before carrying out any operation, and thus the files are extracted to
[/root/myscripts] instead of the current directory.

Now let\'s verify that the files were indeed extracted to the
[/root/myscripts] directory:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:/# ls /root/myscripts
3x10.sh 
empty.sh 
fun1.sh 
hello20.sh 
hello3.sh 
math.sh 
noweb.sh 
rename.sh 
size3.sh 
detect.sh 
filetype.sh 
game.sh 
hello2.sh 
hello.sh 
mydate.sh 
numbers.sh 
size2.sh 
size.sh
```

And sure enough, we see all our bash scripts in the
[/root/myscripts] directory!


Compressing with gzip
=====================

To compress the [scripts.tar] archive into a
[gzip]-compressed archive named [scripts.tar.gz], you first
need to change to the [/root/backup] directory and then run the
following command:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# tar -czf scripts.tar.gz scripts.tar
```

Now if you list the contents of the [backup] directory, you will
see the newly created [gzip]-compressed archive
[scripts.tar.gz]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# ls 
scripts.tar scripts.tar.gz
```

The magic happened by using the [-z] option, which compressed the
archive with the [gzip] compression method. And that\'s it! Notice
how it\'s very similar to creating an archive: we just added the
[-z] option -- that\'s the only difference.

Now let\'s run the [file] command on both archives:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# file scripts.tar 
scripts.tar: POSIX tar archive (GNU) 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# file scripts.tar.gz
scripts.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, last modified: Sat Nov 2 22:13:44 2019, 
from Unix
```

As you can see, the [file] command detects the type of both
archives. Now let's compare the size (in bytes) of both archives:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# du -b scripts.tar scripts.tar.gz 
20480 scripts.tar
1479 scripts.tar.gz
```

The compressed archive [scripts.tar.gz] is way smaller in size as
we expected compared to the uncompressed archive [scripts.tar]. If
you want to extract the files in the compressed archive
[scripts.tar.gz] to [/root/myscripts], you can run:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# tar -xf scripts.tar.gz -C /root/myscripts
```

Notice it is exactly the same as the way that you would extract the
contents of an uncompressed archive.


Compressing with bzip2
======================

To compress the [scripts.tar] archive into a
[bzip2]-compressed archive named [scripts.tar.bz2], you
first need to change to the [/root/backup] directory and then run
the following command:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# tar -cjf scripts.tar.bz2 scripts.tar
```

Now if you list the contents of the [backup] directory, you will
see the newly created [bzip2]-compressed archive
[scripts.tar.bz2]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# ls
scripts.tar scripts.tar.bz2 scripts.tar.gz
```

Let\'s run the [file] command on the [bzip2]-compressed
archive [scripts.tar.bz2]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# file scripts.tar.bz2 
scripts.tar.bz2: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```

It correctly detects the type of compression method used for the archive
[scripts.tar.bz2]. Awesome -- now let\'s compare the size (in
bytes) of the [gzip]-compressed archive [scripts.tar.gz] and
the [bzip2]-compressed archive [scripts.tar.bz2]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# du -b scripts.tar.bz2 scripts.tar.gz 
1369 scripts.tar.bz2
1479 scripts.tar.gz
```

Notice that the [bzip2]-compressed archive [scripts.tar.bz2]
is smaller than the [gzip]-compressed archive
[scripts.tar.gz]. If you want to extract the files in the
compressed archive [scripts.tar.bz2] to [/root/myscripts],
you can run:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# tar -xf scripts.tar.bz2 -C /root/myscripts
```

Notice it is exactly the same as the way that you would extract the
contents of a [gzip]-compressed archive.


Compressing with xz
===================


The [xz] compression method is yet another popular compression
method used on Linux. On average, [xz] compression does the best
job out of all three compression methods in reducing (compressing) the
file sizes.

You can compress an archive with [xz] compression by using the
[-J] option with the [tar] command as follows:

``` 
tar -cJf compressed_name archive_name
```

Notice here we use the uppercase letter [J] with [xz]
compression. So to compress the [scripts.tar] archive into an
[xz]-compressed archive named [scripts.tar.xz], you first
need to change to the [/root/backup] directory and then run the
following command:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# tar -cJf scripts.tar.xz scripts.tar
```

Now if you list the contents of the [backup] directory, you will
see the newly created [xz]-compressed archive
[scripts.tar.xz]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# ls
scripts.tar scripts.tar.bz2 scripts.tar.gz scripts.tar.xz
```

Let\'s run the file command on the [xz]-compressed archive
[scripts.tar.xz]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# file scripts.tar.xz 
scripts.tar.xz: XZ compressed data
```

It correctly detects the type of compression method used for the archive
[scripts.tar.xz].


Measuring performance
=====================


You can use the [time] command to measure the time it takes a
command (or a program) to finish executing. The general syntax for the
[time] command is as follows:

``` 
time command_or_program
```

For example, to measure how long it takes for the [date] command
to finish executing, you can run the following command:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~# time date 
Sun Nov 3 16:36:33 CST 2019

real 0m0.004s 
user 0m0.003s 
sys 0m0.000s
```

It just took four milliseconds to run the [date] command on my
system; this is quite fast!

The [gzip] compression method is the fastest of all three
compression methods; well, let\'s see if I am lying or telling the
truth! Change to the [/root/backup] directory:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~# cd /root/backup 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup#
```

Now let\'s see how long it takes to create a [gzip]-compressed
archive file for all the files in [/boot]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# time tar -czf boot.tar.gz /boot 
real 0m4.717s
user 0m4.361s 
sys 0m0.339s
```

On my system, it took [gzip] 4.717 seconds to run! Now let\'s
measure the time it takes to create a [bzip2]-compressed archive
of the same directory [/boot]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# time tar -cjf boot.tar.bz2 /boot 
real 0m19.306s
user 0m18.809s 
sys   0m0.359s
```

It took [bzip2] an enormous [19.306] seconds to run! You can
see how [gzip] compression is much faster than [bzip2]. Now
let\'s see the time it takes to create an [xz]-compressed archive
of the same directory [/boot]:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# time tar -cJf boot.tar.xz /boot 
real 0m53.745s
user 0m52.679s 
sys   0m0.873s
```

It almost took [xz] a full minute! We can conclude that
[gzip] is definitely the fastest of all three compression methods
we have discussed.

Finally, let\'s check the size (in bytes) of the three compressed
archives:

``` 
root@ubuntu-linux:~/backup# du -b boot.* 
97934386 boot.tar.bz2
98036178 boot.tar.gz
94452156 boot.tar.xz
```

As you can see, [xz] did the best job of compressing the files.
[bzip2] claimed second place, and [gzip] came in last.


Knowledge check
===============


For the following exercises, open up your Terminal and try to solve the
following tasks:

1.  Create a [gzip] archive named [var.tar.gz] in
    [/root] for all the files in [/var].
2.  Create a [bzip2] archive named [tmp.tar.bz2] in
    [/root] for all the files in [/tmp].
3.  Create an [xz] archive named [etc.tar.xz] in
    [/root] for all the files in [/etc].
