Lab: Copying, Moving, and Deleting Files
----------------------------------------

If you have ever owned a computer before, then you know how important it
is to be able to copy and move files around. That\'s why I dedicated an
entire lab to talk just about that: copying, moving, and deleting
files.

**Note:** Make sure to add following text in `/home/elliot/cats.txt` before starting the lab.

```
I love cars!
I love cats!
I love penguins!
```

Copying one file
================


Sometimes you need to copy a single file. Luckily this is a simple
operation on the command line. I have a file named [cats.txt] in
my home directory:


``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cat cats.txt 
I love cars!
I love cats!
I love penguins!
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

I can use the [cp] command to make a copy of [cats.txt]
named [copycats.txt] as follows:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cp cats.txt copycats.txt 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cat copycats.txt
I love cars!
I love cats!
I love penguins!
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

As you can see, the copied file [copycats.txt] has the same
content as the original file [cats.txt].

I can also copy the file [cats.txt] to another directory. For
example, I can copy the file [cats.txt] to [/tmp] by running
the [cp cats.txt /tmp] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cp cats.txt /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ ls cat*
cats.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$
```

Notice that the copied file has the same name as the original file. I
can also make another copy in **[/tmp]** with a different name:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cp cats.txt /tmp/cats2.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ ls cat*
cats2.txt  cats.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$
```


Copying multiple files
======================


You may also want to copy multiple files at once. To demonstrate, let\'s
begin by creating three files [apple.txt], [banana.txt], and
[carrot.txt] in Elliot\'s home directory:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ touch apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
apple.txt carrot.txt copycats.txt dir1 
banana.txt cats.txt Desktop
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

To copy the three newly created files to [/tmp], you can run the
[cp apple.txt ba- nana.txt carrot.txt /tmp] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cp apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt cats2.txt cats.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$
```

Child's play! In general, the [cp] command follows the syntax:

``` 
cp source_file(s) destination
```


Copying one directory
=====================


You may also want to copy an entire directory; that\'s also easily
accomplished. To demonstrate, create a directory named [cities] in
your home directory, and inside [cities], create three files
[paris], [tokyo], and [london] as follows:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mkdir cities
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd cities/
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/cities$ touch paris tokyo london
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/cities$ ls
london paris tokyo
```

Now if you want to copy the [cities] directory to [/tmp],
you have to pass the recursive [-r] option to the [cp]
command as follows:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/cities$ cd ..
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cp -r cities /tmp
```

You will get an error message if you omitted the [-r] option:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cp cities /tmp
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'cities'
```

You can verify that the [cities] directory is copied to
[/tmp] by listing the files in [/tmp]:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt cats2.txt cats.txt cities
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ ls cities
london paris tokyo
```


Copying multiple directories
============================


You can also copy multiple directories the same way you copy multiple
files; the only difference is that you have to pass the recursive
[-r] option to the [cp] command.

To demonstrate, create the three directories [d1], [d2], and
[d3] in Elliot\'s home directory:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mkdir d1 d2 d3
```

Now you can copy all three directories to [/tmp] by running the
[cp -r d1 d2 d3 /tmp] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cp -r d1 d2 d3 /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt cats2.txt cats.txt cities d1 d2 d3
```


Moving one file
===============


Sometimes, you may want to move a file (or a directory) to a different
location instead of copying and wasting disk space.

To do this, you can use the [mv] command. For example, you can
move the file [copycats.txt] from Elliot\'s home directory to
[/tmp] by running the [mv copycats.txt /tmp] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mv copycats.txt /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
apple.txt   carrot.txt cities d2  Desktop  Downloads
banana.txt  cats.txt   d1     d3  dir1     Pictures
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd /tmp
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ ls
apple.txt  carrot.txt cats.txt copycats.txt d2
banana.txt cats2.txt  cities   d1           d3
```

Notice that [copycats.txt] is now gone from Elliot\'s home
directory as it relocated to [/tmp].


Moving multiple files
=====================


You can also move multiple files the same way you can copy multiple
files. For example, you can move the three files [apple.txt],
[banana.txt], and [carrot.txt] from [/tmp] to
[/home/elliot/d1] as follows:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ mv apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt /home/elliot/d1
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ ls
cats2.txt cats.txt cities copycats.txt d1 d2 d3
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/tmp$ cd /home/elliot/d1
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/d1$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/d1$
```

As you can see, the three files [apple.txt], [banana.txt],
and [carrot.txt] are no longer located in [/tmp] as they all
moved to [/home/elliot/d1]. In general, the [mv] command
follows the syntax:

``` 
mv source_file(s) destination
```


Moving one directory
====================


You can also use the [mv] command to move directories. For
example, if you want to move the directory [d3] and put it inside
[d2], then you can run the [mv d3 d2] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mv d3 d2
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd d2
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/d2$ ls 
d3
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/d2$
```

Notice that you don\'t need to use the recursive [-r] option to
move a directory.


Moving multiple directories
===========================


You can also move multiple directories at once. To demonstrate, create a
directory named [big] in Elliot\'s home directory:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mkdir big
```

Now you can move the three directories [d1], [d2], and
[cities] to the [big] directory as follows:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mv d1 d2 cities big
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls big
cities d1 d2
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```


Renaming files
==============


You can also use the [mv] command to rename files. For example, if
you want to rename the file [cats.txt] to [dogs.txt], you
can run the [mv cats.txt dogs.txt] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mv cats.txt dogs.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cat dogs.txt
I love cars!
I love cats!
I love penguins!
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

If you want to rename the directory [big] to [small], you
can run the [mv big small] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mv big small
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls small 
cities d1 d2
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

In summary, here is how the [mv] command works:

1.  If the destination directory exists, the [mv] command will
    move the source file(s) to the destination directory.
2.  If the destination directory doesn't exist, the [mv] command
    will rename the source file.

Keep in mind that you can only rename one file (or one directory) at a
time.


Hiding files
============


You can hide any file by renaming it to a name that starts with a dot.

Let\'s try it; you can hide the file [dogs.txt] by renaming it to
[.dogs.txt] as follows:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt dogs.txt Desktop dir1 small
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mv dogs.txt .dogs.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt Desktop dir1 small
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

As you can see, the file [dogs.txt] is now hidden as it got
renamed to [.dogs.txt]. You can unhide [.dogs.txt] by
renaming it and removing the leading dot from the filename:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mv .dogs.txt dogs.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt dogs.txt Desktop dir1 small
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

Yes, Sir! You can also hide and unhide directories in the same manner. I
will leave that for you to do as an exercise.


Removing files
==============


You can use the [rm] command to remove (delete) files. For
example, if you want to remove the file [dogs.txt], you can run
the [rm dogs.txt] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt dogs.txt Desktop dir1 small
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rm dogs.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt Desktop dir1 small
```

You can also remove multiple files at once. For example, you can remove
the three files [apple.txt], [banana.txt], and
[carrot.txt] by running the [rm apple.txt banana.txt
carrot.txt] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rm apple.txt banana.txt carrot.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
Desktop dir1 small 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```


Removing directories
====================


You can pass the recursive [-r] option to the [rm] command
to remove directories. To demonstrate, let's first create a directory
named [garbage] in Elliot\'s home directory:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mkdir garbage
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
Desktop dir1 garbage small
```

Now let\'s try to remove the [garbage] directory:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rm garbage
rm: cannot remove 'garbage': Is a directory
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

Shoot! I got an error because I didn\'t pass the recursive [-r]
option. I will pass the recursive option this time:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rm -r garbage
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
Desktop dir1 small
```

Cool! We got rid of the [garbage] directory.

You can also use the [rmdir] command to remove only empty
directories. To demonstrate, let's create a new directory named
[garbage2] and inside it, create a file named [old]:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mkdir garbage2
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd garbage2
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/garbage2$ touch old
```

Now let\'s go back to Elliot\'s home directory and attempt to remove
[garbage2] with the [rmdir] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/garbage2$ cd ..
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rmdir garbage2
rmdir: failed to remove 'garbage2': Directory not empty
```

As you can see, it wouldn't allow you to remove a nonempty directory.
Therefore, let\'s delete the file [old] that's inside
[garbage2] and then reattempt to remove [garbage2]:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rm garbage2/old
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rmdir garbage2
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
Desktop dir1 small 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

Boom! The [garbage2] directory is gone forever. One thing to
remember here is that the [rm -r] command will remove any
directory (both empty and nonempty). On the other hand, the
[rmdir] command will only delete empty directories.

For the final example in this lab, let\'s create a directory named
[garbage3], then create two files [a1.txt] and
[a2.txt] inside it:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ mkdir garbage3
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd garbage3/
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/garbage3$ touch a1.txt a2.txt
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/garbage3$ ls
a1.txt a2.txt
```

Now let\'s get back to Elliot\'s home directory and attempt to remove
[garbage3]:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~/garbage3$ cd ..
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rmdir garbage3
rmdir: failed to remove 'garbage3': Directory not empty
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ rm -r garbage3
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ ls
Desktop dir1 Downloads Pictures small
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$
```

As you can see, the [rmdir] command has failed to remove the
nonempty directory [garbage3], while the [rm -r] command has
successfully removed it.

Nothing makes information stick in your head like a good knowledge-check
exercise.
