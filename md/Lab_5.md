Lab: Linux Command Types
========================


All Linux commands must fall into one of these following four
categories:

1.  **An executable program**: Which is usually written in the C
    programming language. The [cp] command is an example of an
    executable command.
2.  **An alias**: Which is basically another name for a command (or a
    group of commands).
3.  **A shell builtin**: The shell supports internal commands as well.
    The [exit] and [cd] commands are two examples of a shell
    builtin command.
4.  **A shell function**: These are functions that help us achieve a
    specific task and are essential in writing shell scripts. We will
    cover this in more detail later, for now, just know they exist.


Determining a command\'s type
=============================


You can use the [type] command to determine the type (category) of
a command. For example, if you want to know the type of the [pwd]
command you can simply run the [type pwd] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ type pwd 
pwd is a shell builtin
```

So now you know that the [pwd] command is a shell builtin command.
Now let\'s figure out the type of the [ls] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ type ls
ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'
```

As you can see, the [ls] command is aliased to [ls
\--color=auto]. Now you know why you see a colorful output every
time you run the [ls] command. Let\'s see the type of the
[date] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ type date 
date is /bin/date
```

Any command that lives in [/bin] or [/sbin] is an executable
program. Therefore, we can conclude that the [date] command is an
executable program as it resides in [/bin].

Finally, let\'s determine the type of the [type] command itself:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ type type 
type is a shell builtin
```

It turns out the [type] command is a shell builtin command.


Finding a command\'s location
=============================


Every time you run an executable command, there a file somewhere on the
system that gets executed. You can use the [which] command to
determine the location of an executable command. For example, if you
want to know the location of the [rm] command, you can run the
[which rm] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ which rm
/bin/rm
```

So now you know that [rm] lives in the [/bin] directory.
Let\'s see the location of the [reboot] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ which reboot
/sbin/reboot
```

As you can see, the [reboot] command lives in the [/sbin]
directory.


What does the command do?
=========================


You can use the [whatis] command to get a brief description of
what a command does. For example, if you want to know the purpose of the
[free] command, you can run the [whatis free] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ whatis free
free (1)             - Display amount of free and used memory in the system
```

As you can see, the [free] command, as we already know, displays
the amount of free and used memory in the system. Cool! Now let\'s see
what the [df] command does:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ whatis df
df (1)               - report file system disk space usage
```

Finally, let\'s see what the [which] command does:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ whatis which 
which (1)            - locate a command
```

As we already know, [which] displays a command\'s location.


Help for shell builtins
=======================

You can find help on how to use
shell builtins by using the [help] command. For example, to get
help on how to use the [exit] command, you can run:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ help exit 
exit: exit [n]
    Exit the shell.

    Exits the shell with a status of N. If N is omitted, the exit status 
    is that of the last command executed.
```

Similarly, to get help on how to use the [cd] command, you can run
the [help cd] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ help cd 
cd: cd [-L|-P] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.

    Change the current directory to DIR. The default DIR is the value of 
    the HOME shell variable.

    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing DIR.  
    Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:). 
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory. 
    If DIR begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.

    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set, 
    the word is assumed to be a variable name. If that variable has a value, 
    its value is used for DIR.

    Options:
        -L force symbolic links to be followed
        -P use the physical directory structure without following symbolic links
    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified. 

    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed; non-zero otherwise.
```


The info page
=============


The GNU project launched the [info] pages as an alternative
documentation to the [man] pages. The GNU project once claimed
that [man] pages are outdated and needed replacement and so they
came up with the [info] pages.

You can view the [info] page of any command by running:

``` 
info command_name
```

For example, to view the [info] page of the [ls] command,
you can run the [info ls] command:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ info ls

Next: dir invocation, Up: Directory listing

10.1 'ls': List directory contents
==================================

The 'ls' program lists information about files (of any type, including directories). Options and file arguments can be intermixed arbitrarily, as usual.

For non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by default 'ls' lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and omitting files with names beginning with '.'. For other non-option arguments, by default 'ls' lists just the file name. If no non-option argument is specified, 'ls' operates on the current directory, acting as if it had been invoked with a single argument of '.'.

By default, the output is sorted alphabetically, according to the locale settings in effect.(1) If standard output is a terminal, the output is in columns (sorted vertically) and control characters are output as question marks; otherwise, the output is listed one per line and control characters are output as-is.

Because 'ls' is such a fundamental program, it has accumulated many options over the years. They are described in the subsections below; within each section, options are listed alphabetically (ignoring case). The division of options into the subsections is not absolute, since some options affect more than one aspect of 'ls''s operation.
```



The /usr/share/doc directory
============================


The [/usr/share/doc] directory is another excellent place to look
for help in Linux. This directory has very intensive documentation; it
doesn\'t just show you how to use a command; sometimes, it will even
show the name and contact information of the authors who developed the
command. Moreover, it may also include a [TODO] file that contains
a list of unfinished tasks/features; contributors usually check the
[TODO] files to help fix bugs and develop new features.

To demonstrate, let\'s go to the [nano] documentation directory:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd /usr/share/doc/nano 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/usr/share/doc/nano$ pwd
/usr/share/doc/nano
```

Now list the contents of the directory to see what\'s inside:

``` 
elliot@ubuntu-linux:/usr/share/doc/nano$ ls

AUTHORS          NEWS.gz  THANKS.gz  changelog.Debian.gz  examples  nano.html
IMPROVEMENTS.gz  README   TODO       copyright            faq.html
```

As you saw in this lab, Linux has a variety of helpful tools
available at your disposal; so make sure you utilize them!


Knowledge check
===============


For the following exercises, open up your Terminal and try to solve the
following tasks:

1.  You need to know if the [echo] command is a shell builtin or
    an executable program, which command would you run?
2.  Display the location of the [uptime] command executable file.
3.  Show a brief description of the [mkdir] command.
4.  You forgot how to use the [mv] command, what are you going to
    do?
5.  You forgot which command is used to display the calendar, what are
    you going to do?
6.  The [history] command is a shell builtin and so it doesn\'t
    have a man page. You want to clear your history but don\'t know how.
    What are you going to do?

True or false
-------------

1.  The command [whereis] is used to locate commands.
2.  You can use [man -p] and [apropos] interchangeably.
3.  You can use the [whatis] command to get a brief description of
    a command.
4.  You can use the [type] command to determine if a command is an
    alias, shell builtin, or an executable program.
